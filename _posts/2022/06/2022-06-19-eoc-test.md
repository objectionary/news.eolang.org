There is [eoc](https://github.com/objectionary/eoc),
a command line tool that helps you automate compilation, transpilation,
and execution of simple EO programs. With this tool you can also
create and execute unit tests. Just name them `*-test.eo` and add
metas `+junit` to them.

<!--more-->

Say, you have a `program.eo` file, which does this:

```
[] > name
  "Jeff Lebowski" > @
[args...] > program
  QQ.io.stdout > @
    name
```

You may want to create a unit test, which will check that your
object `name` actually is the right name. Put it into the `program-test.eo`
file (actually, you can pick any name of the file you like):

```
+junit
+alias name
+alias org.eolang.hamcrest.assert-that

[] > the-name-is-right
  assert-that > @
    name.length
    $.all-of
      $.greater-than 10
      $.less-than 100
```

Then, simply say:

```
$ eoc test
```

The test will be found and executed.
