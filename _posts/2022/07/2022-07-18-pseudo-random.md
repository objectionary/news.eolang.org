title: "Pseudo-random generation in EO"

EO library provides an ability to generate pseudo-random sequences.
It's analogous to [Random](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Random.html) class
in _Java_ or [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) module in _Python_.  
Let's explore how this facility
(exposed via [org.eolang.math.random](https://github.com/objectionary/home/blob/master/objects/org/eolang/math/random.eo)
object) can be used in EO.

<!--more-->
[random](https://github.com/objectionary/home/blob/master/objects/org/eolang/math/random.eo) object
available in `eo.lang.math` package since version `0.1.2`. It decorates `float`
and represents a value from random sequence.

Note that the generator is [pseudo-random](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator).
In short, it means that generated sequence can be reproduced given initial seed value which is 
not what true randomness normally assumes.  
In most applied cases pseudo-randomness is perfectly 
enough. Hereafter terms _random_ and _pseudo-random_ will be used interchangeably. 

Single random value can be generated as follows:
```
+alias org.eolang.math.random

[args...] > app
  QQ.io.stdout > @
    QQ.txt.sprintf
      "Random value is %f"
      random.pseudo
```
Here `random.pseudo` object represents `float` object with random value 
in range `0..1` (0 included, 1 excluded).

An array of 5 random values can be generated like this:
```
[args...] > app
  random.pseudo > rnd!
  reduce. > @
    list (* 1 2 3 4 5)
    *
    [a i]
      a.with rnd.next > @
```
In this case first call to `rnd` generates new `random` object. Each consecutive call to
`rnd.next` produces next `float` value in random sequence. Values produced by `random.next`
are normally distributed in range `0..1`. Under the hood `random.next` uses 
[Linear congruential method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator) to
generate next random element.

Initial seed can be used to reproduce the sequence of values generated by `random.next`:
```
[args...] > equal-app
  eq. > @
    (random 3142).next.next.next.next
    (random 3142).next.next.next.next
```
In this example `equal-app` will evaluate to `TRUE`. Moreover, corresponding elements 
(i.e. produces by the same number of `next` calls) of both sequences will be equal.
However, in the following snippet different initial seeds will generate different sequences:
```
[args...] > not-equal-app
  eq. > @
    (random 5938).next.next.next.next
    (random 3142).next.next.next.next
```
