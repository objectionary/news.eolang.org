<span style="color:firebrick;"><strong>ATTENTION!</strong></span>
We are also hiring interns (BSc and MSc students). 
Find me in Telegram, we will discuss: 
[yegor256](https://t.me/yegor256).

[EOLANG](https://www.eolang.org) is an R&D project, where we create a new programming language
in order to introduce new techniques of object-oriented programming. 
We believe that existing object-oriented languages, such as Java and C++,
are not strong enough in their adherence to the object paradigm
originally introduced by Alan Kay and earlier implemented in languages
like [Smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk) and 
[Self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_%28programming_language%29). 
Besides that, we expect to explore the possibility 
of using our new language as an intermediate representation in the
process of optimization of mainstream languages. EOLANG is based on
[𝜑-calculus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13384), which is a formal 
foundation for it and potentially for other object-oriented languages.

We have a few open positions in our team:

  * Java developer
  * C++ developer
